# MinimalisticCrosser
It's a minimalistic game based on the popular arcade game which generally involves crossing a path of some sort 
with obstacles in between. The code focuses on the gameplay aspects, and is thus minimalist.
The code is mostly clear, however it should have been more DRY. Some values used are hacky, specifically when considering
boundary values etc.
